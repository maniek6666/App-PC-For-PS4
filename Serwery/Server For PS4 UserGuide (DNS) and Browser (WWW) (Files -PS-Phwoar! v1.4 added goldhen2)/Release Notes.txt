Main Menu Features:
---------------------
When the menu loads, you can just press the X button to instantly run the latest version of HEN.

Press the 'R1' button to see a description of the selected payload.
(Special Payloads like Fan Control, Firmware Spoofer and ReactPSPlus-MOD display extra information when 
you press 'R1' like 'Current Fan Control Temperature setting' 'Current Official and Spoofed Firmware versions' 
and 'Current system clock and kernel clock times')

AutoHen Feature:
---------------------
To toggle the AutoHen feature On or Off use the L2 button.
If AutoHen is turned on, Hen will automatically load when you first open the menu. 
Once Hen is loaded on your PS4 the regular PS-Phwoar! menu will open instead allowing you to access all the other payloads.

Payload Features:
-------------------
Hen:
When you first run Hen will take a 3 seconds longer to load than all the other payloads in the menu. 
This is perfectly normal. When your PS4 first turned on it is not exploited so it takes a few extra seconds 
because it is patching your kernel first before running HEN.

Bin Loader:
This version of Bin Loader can also load extra large bin payloads. Other versions of Bin Loader usually have a 
bin file size limit of 3.14MB but this version can handle bin files up to 12.58MB in size. Perfect for loading 
large bin files like the 10MB NO-USB Linux loader payload.

Fan Control Payload:
When the Fan Control payload has loaded you can move the slider using either D-Pad up & down or D-Pad left and right.
Press X to set the desired temperature threshold.
A special feature of this payload which makes it unique from the other FanControl payloads is that you can move the slider 
and set the temperature over and over again without having to exit and re-enter the menu!
