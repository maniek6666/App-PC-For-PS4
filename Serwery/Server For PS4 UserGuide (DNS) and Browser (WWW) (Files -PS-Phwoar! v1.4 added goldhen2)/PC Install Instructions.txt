Self Host Options:
---------------------
If you want to load the menu in the PS4's Browser use the 'Server For PS4 Browser.bat' and follow the instructions it tells you.
If you want to load the menu in the PS4's UserGuide use the 'Server For PS4 UserGuide.exe' and follow the instructions it tells you.

Whichever server you use, once the PS-Phwoar! Host Menu has finished installing on your PS4 you can close the server 
and the Host menu will then always load from your PS4's internal cache.

Before you install or Update PS-Phwoar! on your PS4 it is advised to first clear your browser settings so that it does not interfere 
with any previous Host menus you have used. 
To do this open the Browser app and press the options button then select:
Settings > Delete Cookies > Clear Website Data.
